#### To-Do

- [ ] Stakeholder Indentification
- [ ] Roadmap
- [ ] Entities and Relationships

---

## Project Scope:
- The project aims to build a database management system for a cab booking system. We will design a frontend application with a robust backend database management system using the various DBMS concepts taught in the course CSE202. The project is aimed to create such a database where a person can easily get a vehicle for it’s transport without any hassle.

## Technical requirements (Tech Stack):

1. Front End:

- **JavaScript, React Framework**: JavaScript is the most popular and widely used scripting programming language for web applications which can be used both client and server side. We aim to use the React open-source library to build the user interface for this project.  

- **Figma**: Figma is an application used to design interfaces for various applications. We can prototype the basic functionality required in the application and then use **HTML and CSS** to implement the design in our project. We can also further use Figma to create or use existing design languages and design a graphic identity. 

2. Back End:

- **MySQL**: MySQL is an open-source relational database management system. We can use it create the database required for this project by storing and retrieving the various data points created in the database. 

- **Python, Django Framework**: Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language which can also be use for web applications using the Django Framework. We can use these frameworks to develop basic and additional functionalities in our project. 

- **APIs, Third-party Integrations** (to expand scope of the project): To further add more functionality and usbability in the application we can make use of APIs that work in the backend for location, payment, authentication services. 

- Further as we go on the process of building the application there might be additions to these technical requirements as the scope of the project changes. 

## Functional Requirements:

- The customer can go to the desired destinations with the help of the cab anytime.
  
- All the travels done by the customer will be recorded in this database system.
  
- Information about the customer and the driver/vehicle will also be recorded. 
  
- The customer chooses the pick up destination and then chooses the location where the person wants to go. 
  
- Nearest cabs are shown to the customer to choose from and type of vehicle desired. 
  
- Various type of vehicles will be made available with different prices for each type of vehicle, for eg: if the customer wishes to  travel by a bike or an auto then prices will be shown accordingly. 
  
- The payment can be done in both offline and online means.
  
- The customer can even schedule a cab according to convenience. A cab can even be rented for personal use with prices depending accordingly.
  
- The travel history is documented for record keeping purposes and can be accessed by the customer account holder.
